The girl wrote a letter to her friend .
I think that it is raining .
He tried to stop smoking and drinking .
Do you want to go ?
Sam , open the window !
She made her husband wash the car .
Peter â€™s neighbor painted the fence red .
My dad is cooler than yours .
Mary won bronze , Peter silver , and Jane gold .
Is Iguazu a big or a small country ?
Neither Peter Smith nor Mary Brown could be selected .
They have no idea who wrote it .
What are you looking at ?
When do you think you can come ?
He bought a car but his brother just a bike .
Peter and Mary hugged each other and then left the room .
She should have been doing her hair but for some reason she would n't that day .
I was n't able to keep up , because he ran too fast .
This letter is from Peter and it was delivered yesterday .
She grew up in Paris , the capital of France .
